## Writing Lab 1
- Due every Friday 11:59p
- Concepts
	- Cummulative - A, use terminology from current and previous lectures
		- **policy vacuums**: when no explicit policies are in place to cope with a new tehcnology (not sure what to do)
		- **conceptual muddles**: when a new technology blurs the lines between what were traditionally distinct ideas (not sure what it is)
	- Not-Commulative - B
	- Shit - C
	- Crap - D
- Reading - How well you read the writing prompts
- Argument
	- Clear thesis statement, backed up w/ evidence, B vs. A? other views and how they differ and "i understand", but underlying principal is dangerous precedent, no strawman
- Writing
	- Pleasanton to read (draft + rewrite), 
- Thesis
	- Make it as specific as possible
		- E.g. "Producing cars today that sell to consumers that advertise themselves as self-drivig while the technology is no where near the level because it gives a false sense of confidence..."
