## How to use this
This is just a general dump of notes I take during class. One benefit of MD is the ability to use LaTex so I use that for the mathematical notation.

File naming scheme:
`[course number]-[lec/lab]-#.md`

## Future work:
I want to be able to query for certain things, perform regex on class, some sort of RegEx cross SQL query type thing where I can search for a topic and get a curated list of notes to read up on. Probably will code this all up in Python or something.
