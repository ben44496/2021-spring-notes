Problem 1: All strings in which number of $0$s is even and the number of $1$s is not divisible by $3$.

$\Sigma = \{0,1\}$
$Q = Q_1\times Q_2 = \{(q_1, q_2): q_1\in Q_1, q_2\in Q_2\}$
$A = \{(q_1, q_2): q_1\in A_1 \text{ and } q_2 \in A_2\}$
$s = (s_1, s_2)$
$\delta((q_1,q_2),+) = (\delta_1(q_1,+),\delta_2(q_2,+))$
