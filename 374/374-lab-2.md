## Regular Expressions

#### Order of Operations
*Kleene Closure $(*)$ > Concatenation$(\bullet)$ > Union $(+)$*

E.g. $10(1+0)^*0^*+1^*0 = (\{1\}\bullet\{0\}\bullet\{0,1\}^*\bullet\{0\}^*) + (\{1\}^*\bullet\{0\})$

#### Problems Today:
1. All strings containing the substring 000
$w = ...000...$
$R = (1+0)^*000(1+0)^*$

2. All strings not containing the substring 000
$R = (\epsilon + 0 + 00)(100+10+1)$
Think: Use $1$ to break up $0$s, then add a beginning case.

3. All strings in which every run of 0s has length at least 3
$()$
Think: Use $1$ in front of every $0$s
4. All strings in which every 1 appears before any substring 000


5. All strings containing at least three 0s
$R = (0+1)^*0(0+1)^*0(0+1)^*0(0+1)^*$

6. Every string except 000
	Case 1: $|w| < 3$
	$R_1 = (\epsilon + 0 + 1 + 00 + 01 + 10 + 11)$

	Case 2: $|w|=3$, but does not include $000$
	$R_2 = (001 + 010 + 100 + 011 + 101 + 110 + 111)$
	$R_2 = ((0+1)1(0+1) + (0+1)(0+1)1 + 1(0+1)(0+1))$

	Case 3: $|w|>3$
	$R_3 = (0+1)(0+1)(0+1)(0+1)(0+1)^*$
	
	$R = R_1+R_2+R_3$
