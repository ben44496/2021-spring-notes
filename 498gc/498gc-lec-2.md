### Autonomy vs. Automation
- Automation
	- Clear executive specifications
	- Deterministic actions
	- Closed world controlled environment
	- Structured Signals
- Autonomy
	- Ambiguous specifications, executive specs need to be generated by robot
	- Stochastic actions and stochastic outcomes
	- Uncontrolled real-world in the wild environment
	- Symbols extracted from unstructured raw

### Levels of Autonomy
- for Autonomous Cars
	- L1 - Hands off
	- L2 - Eyes off
	- L3 - Mind off
	- L4 - No Driver
- for Field Robots
	- L1 - Hands off
	- L2 - Eyes off
	- L3 - One to many control
	- L4 - No supervisor on field
	- L5 - Planning off
- Trust is defined as time between intervention

# Linear Algebra
- Scaling, Rotation, Translation matrix
- Inverse: $(ABC)^{-1} = C^{-1}B^{-1}A^{-1}$
- Vector spaces
- Subspaces, every subspace must contain 0 vector
- Null(A) is orthogonal to Col(A)
- Determinant exists to see if the Col(A) are linearly independent
- $A = uv^T$ (see in gradient descent for example) has at most rank 1
- Least Squares: $x = (A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb$
	- Solution only exists if there is $(A^TA)^{-1}$, that is when A has full column rank or there are at least $m$ linearly independent rows in A
	- If this is not the case, then a solution is $x = x_p + x_n$ where $x_p$ is one particular solution, and $x_n \in N(A)$ is any vector in the null space of A
- Linear Independence
	- A is full ranked
	- A is non singular
	- A has nonzero determinant
	- $N(A)$ is zero
	- The Range space of A is $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- the columns of $A$ form a complete basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
	- Projects have eigenvalues of 1 and -
	- Reflections have eigen values of 1 and -1
	- Rotatios have complex eigenvalues, $e^{i\theta}, e^{-1\theta}$
	- $det(A) = \lambda_1\lambda_2...\lambda_n$
	- $trace(A) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + ... + \lambda_n$

## State Space Models (Linear)
Goals:
- State space representation
- Definitions of state, state variables, state vector, state space, state trajectory, input and output
- State space representation of dynamic systems
- Solution of state space models
- Controllability and observability
- (for later) State feedback control: Pole placemeent

Definitions:
**State**: The state of a dynamic system is the *smallest set of variables* (called state variables) such that the knowledge of these variables at initial time $t = t_0$, together witht he knowledge of the input for $t \geq $t_0$, completely determines the behavior of the system for $t \geq t_0$
- Current state, control system, and system model completely defines future response

**State Variables**: The variables that make up the state of the dynamic system. If $n$ variables, ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$), *are required to completely describe the behavior of the system*, then such $n$ variables are a set of state variables.
`Note: Behavior and State depend on the problem statement.`
**State Trajectory**: The path representing the state of the system in a state space: $x$
**Inputs**: Inputs describe the external exitation of the dynamics; and are extrinsic to the system dynamics: $u(t)$
**Outputs**: Outputs describe the directly measured variables; outputs are a function of the state variables and inputs; output are not independent variables: $y(t)$
`Note: Everything in real life is continuous state space`

$\dot{x} = f(x,u,t)$
$y(t) = g(x,u,t)$
$x(t) is the state vector, $u(t)$ is the input vector, ...

**Question**: Does a state-space need to be unique?
`Note: Planning people think in quantizations, `

Foundation Questions in state-space modeling:
- Does a solution $x(t)$ exist for an initial condition $x_0 = x(0)$
- Is it unique?
- Does an equilibrium $x_e$ exist, i.e. 
	- $\exist x_e$ s.t. $f(x_e) = 0$
- Is the equilibrium unique? Doesn't have to be, nonlinear system can have multiple equilibria
- Linear systems have one or infinitely many equillibria

Pendulum Example
- $\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{l}sin\theta + \frac{1}{ml^2}T_a$

Stability: 
- Lyapunov Stability: The origin of the dynamical system of $\dot{x} = f(x)$ is said to be Lyapunov stable if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $||x(0)|| \leq \delta$ then $||x(t)|| \leq \epsilon$
- Asymptotically Stability: The origin of the dynamical system is said to be asymptotically stable if ...
**Question**: Does Stability help inform error bounds or studying error for pertubation?

Linear Time Invariant Systems
- State space model is of the form:
	- $\dot{x} = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$
	- $y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$
