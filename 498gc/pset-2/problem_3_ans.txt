The dynamics do not become realistic. If you calculate the velocity at the points
when it is turning, the forces do not match up. Increasiong amplitude causes it to 
make a lot of turns around the point it wants to go to (think overshoot). Increasing
frequency causes it to want to oscillate a lot more to get to its destination and
so it will turn a lot more which is not possible in real life. The rolling without
slipping assumption inherent in the dynamics is not realistic under these conditions.
