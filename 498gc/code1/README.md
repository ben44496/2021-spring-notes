# Instructions

If you don't see build or devel, please run `catkin_make`

All the code is in `src/`. If you want to run a python file, first `chmod +x` it
and then you can run it as an executable. 

RVIZ for Question 2 and 3 are available in root directory.

`output.txt` is the output for Question 1 and lists the rosbag things.
