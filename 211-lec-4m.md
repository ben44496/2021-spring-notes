How do I get a 4 in argument?
- Structure overall argument well (thesis, topic sentences, evidence and counterarguments)

What makes a good thesis statement?
- *Clear stance* -> "Producing this product is unethical"
- *Specific claim & ethical philosophy* -> "Producing this product is unethical by X standard because of Y."
- *Detailed* -> "Although producing the product itself is ethical enough, the way it was distributed does Y, violating the ethical standard of X"
- Examples:
	- "There are many different consequences of this type of experiment": Shit
	- "Facebook's recent exploration of users emotions may have been legally sound but the public outcry shows that following procedure may not be enough": Not-as-bad Shit
	- "By overlooking basic researchs tandards and not getting explicit consent from their users, Faebook caused more harm to their users, making their actions unethical from a utilitarian standpoint": Good

Topic Sentences:
- Mini thesis statements
- Frame how paragraph fits into overall claim
- Contain argument
- Signposts for structure: "Before we do X, it's important to understand Y"
- Examples:
	- "A significant and novel ethical issue here stems from the fact that Facebook is so massive, ubiquitous, and all encompassing that it can manipulate people in more ways that just the single example in this study.": Good
