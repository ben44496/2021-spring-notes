# Speech, Democracy, and Social Media

## Four modes of Regulation
1. Laws
2. Norms
3. Markets
4. Architecture

## Medium vs. Place
- Is cyberspace a medium or a place?
- Medium - a means for communicating
	- Similar to telephone, radio, or television
	- Regulated as a common carrier
- Place - a public space
	- Similar to a park, street, or house
	- Regulated like a store

## Regulating Speech
## Paradox of Tolerance
- Articulated by philosopher Karl Popper (most famous of ideas in science to make hypothesis that are falsifiable)
- Thesis: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance
- Arg: If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerance society against the onslaught of the intolerance, then then tolerance will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.

## Normalized Censorship
- Content filtering...
- Spam filter - discarding unsolicited/unwelcome electronic messages
- Ad blocking - removing advertising from web
- Up-voting/Liking/Down-voting content
- Scanning for child exploitation material
- ... are all forms of censorship!

## Tavani's definition of Censorship
To **restrict or limit access to an expression**, portion of an expression, or category of expression which has been **made public by its author**, based on the **belief that it will be a bad thing** if people acces the content of that expression.

## Types of Censorship
1. Censorship by supression
	- Preventing material from being distributed
	- Banning the material
2. Censorship by deterrence
	- Punishing those who make the content available
	- Punishing those who week to acquire it

## Legal Concepts
- First Amendment - "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or teh right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances"
- Supreme Court: "clear and present danger" and "imminent lawless action"
	- Can't be vague or indirect
	- Must be real criminal plan or call to violence
- "Advocacy of force or ciriminal activity does not receive First Amendment protections if (1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and (2) is likely to incite or produce such ation." - Brandenberg v. Ohio

## Examples of Unlawful Speech
- Incitement to violence or suicide
- True threats
- "Fighting words"
- Extortion
- Blackmail
- Defamation
- False advertising
- Disclosing classified information
- Child exploitation material
- Intellectual property violations

## Public Forum
- Under US law, an area that the First Amendment protections of speech apply
- Public (government) property: streets, parks, sidewalks, some government buildings, etc.
- Even in public forum, restrictions are allowed on time, place, and manner
	- as long as it is neurtral to the content
	- as long as alternatives are available

## Safe Harbor Laws
- A legal exemption explicitly stating that certain behavior **does not** violate a law
- Two safe harbor laws for platforms:
	1. DMCA safe harbor provision - not liable for copyright infringement by users
	2. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act

## Section 230
- No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider
- No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of
	- any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, ..., violent,... whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or
	- any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1)

## Section 230 Under Attack
- SESTA/FOSTA

## Speech Near the Edge of Legality
- Dangerous info (e.g. bomb schematics)
- Harassment (stalking, bullying)
- Simulated child exploitation material
- Hate speech

## Hate Speech
- Perpetuates marginalization of vulnerable populations (e.g. race, gender, religion, sexual orientation)
- Instills fear in marginalized opulations
- May incite violence

## Challenges of Social Media
## Artificial Friendship
1. Our interactions in social networks are voluntarily
2. Social network identity is conciously, deliberately constructed
3. "True" friendshp involves involuntary social queues to reveal our "real" personality
4. Online friendships are more shallow and artificial
- Everyone is now a "personal brand"
