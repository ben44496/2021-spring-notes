Speculative Fiction

# Cybersecurity
## Cybersecurity
- Protecting uses of cybertechnology
- Objectives: CIA triad
  1. Confidentiality - information kept secret, access rights
  2. Integrity - nobody messing with my documents/program
  3. Availability - no one should be able to knock systems offline, DDoS
- Additional objectives
	- Authenticity - know when we are talking to person/system, dealing with the real thing
	- Accountability - We want a record of what was done, and if something went wrong to do an audit

## Assets
- Assets are the things we want to protect
- Vulnerabilities flaws or weaknesses in our systems
- Exploits - using vulnerabilities to attack an asset
- Data security - proprietary and sensitive data
	- proprietary - has commercial value, is "owned"
	- sensitive - intimate or confidential

## Risk Analysis
- Notoriously difficult in cybersecurity
- de-perimeterisation - security spans the boundaries ofmultiple parties
- problem of many hands - difficult to decide who is responsible

# Ethical Issues
## Incident Response
- When should an organization go public about an attack?
- What informaton should be disclosed?
- How should organization balance eradication (kicking out intruder) vs. recovery (getting back online)?
- Should they notify law enforcement? When?

## Attribution
- How can we know who initiated a cyberattack? How confident can we be?
- Easy for hackers to cover their tracks or flasify information (implicating other victims)
- Proper forensic investigation extremely difficult and crosses many borders
- At what point are we confident enough to attributing an attack to an entity?

## Hack-back
- When under cyberattack, is it ethical to respond in kind?
- Bills proposed to make limited hack-back legal
	- "Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act" amends CFAA
- Possible third parties will be harmed (attribution is hard)
- What if you make a mistake?

## Vulnerability Disclosure
- Nondisclosure - keep vulnerability secret
- Full disclosure - distribute knowledge of the vulnerability, so potential victims can protect themselves
- Limited Disclosure - privately disclosure to the vendor only, so they can develop a patch

## Responsible Disclosure
1. Disclose vulnerability to vendor in private
2. Agree on a deadline for full disclosure
3. Both parties maintain communication during patch development
4. Vulnerability is fully disclosed

## Bug Bounties
- Offer rewards to researchers who discover vulnerabilities
- Encourages responsible disclosure

# Hackers
## Levy's "Hacker Ethic"
I. Access to computers should be unlimited
II. All inforation should be free
III. Mistrust authority
IV. Hackers should be judged by their skill
V. You can create art and beauty on a computer
VI. Computers can change your life for the better

Levy was a journalist who wrote a lot about early hackers. He wrote a distillation of the ethics.

## Problematic Hacker Ethos
1. Information should be free (actively break into stuff)
2. Hackers provide society with a useful service
3. Activities in cyberspace are virtual

## Hacker "Hats"
- Black hat - maliciously breaks into systems for personal gain
- White hat - breaks into systems to improve security
	- "ethical hacker" or "pentester"
- Grey hat - may violate laws or ethical standards, but not maliciously

## Ethical Hacker
Hacking systems with
1. permission
2. expertise
3. document vulnerabilities

## Cybercrime
Crime which is carried out:
- using exclusively cybertechnology to protect
- takes place entirely within cyberspace

## Cyber-related crime
- Conventional crime exacerbated by cybertech
- Examples
  - Cyberstalking
  - Harassment
  - Identity theft
  - Fraud
  - Phishing
  - Spam
  - Libel/Slander
  - Counterfeiting
  - Industrial espionage

## Script Kiddies
- Unskilled wannabe hackers who run scripts written by real Hackers
- Typically teenagers getting up to teenage shenanigans
- They might do a bit of social engineering
- Don't have the technical expertise to understand the attacks

## Hacktivists
- Electronic political activism
- A form of civil disobedience
  - No damage to persons or property
  - Nonviolent
  - Not for personal profit
  - Ethical motivation
  - Willingness to accept personal responsibility

## Cyberterrorists
- Politically motivated hacking intended to cause grave harm
- Grave harm - loss of life, bodily harm, or severe economic loss
- Distinct from harassment or hacktivism?

## Cyberespionage
- Obtaining secret information (violating confidentiality)
- Goal is usually to be stealthy
- Can involve nation states or corporations

## Cyberwarfare
- Nation states engaged in hacking
- Malware and cyberattcks to mislead and disrupt critical infrastructure of adversary
- Not to be confused with **information warfare** - manipulating information
- Advanced Persistant Threat (APT)

## Advanced Persistant Threat (APTs)
- Nation state actors, organized crime, terrorist groups
- Advanced - variety of intrusion methods, custom malware (0-days), exploits tailored for target
- Persistent - attacks for extended period of time, extensive stealthing, penetrates layers of defense, may use multiple intrusions
- **Threat actors** named by incident response companies
  - FireEye numbers them (e.g. APT12)
  - CrowdStrike uses animal names (e.g. Cozy Bear)
  - Kaspersky uses creative names (e.g. Crouching Yeti)

## Famous Threat Actors
- USA
  - Equation Group
- Russia
  - Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear
- etc.

## Other Threat actors
- There are many more:
  - China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea have more
  - Vietnam, France, Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Lebanon, and many more
- Many organized crime groups:
  - Cobalt Group (banking malware)
  - Fin6/Skeleton Spider (POS malware and ransomware)
  - Pinchy Spider (ransomware)
  - Mummy Spider/TA542 (botnets)
- Many terrorist and political groups
- Many with no known attribution
