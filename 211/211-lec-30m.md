- We'll start resume/cover letter next

Presentations:
- During section last 2 weeks of discussion (11/29 and 12/6)
- 4 minutes <- STRICT (practice!)
- Graded by peers and staff (must attend peer presentations)
- Moral argument - Use Tavani's method
- A work of speculative fiction about our field
- Relate it to issues discussed in this course

Speculative Fiction

# Cybersecurity
## Cybersecurity
- Protecting uses of cybertechnology
- Objectives: CIA triad
  1. Confidentiality - information kept secret, access rights
  2. Integrity - nobody messing with my documents/program
  3. Availability - no one should be able to knock systems offline, DDoS
- Additional objectives
	- Authenticity - know when we are talking to person/system, dealing with the real thing
	- Accountability - We want a record of what was done, and if something went wrong to do an audit

## Assets
- Assets are the things we want to protect
- Vulnerabilities flaws or weaknesses in our systems
- Exploits - using vulnerabilities to attack an asset
- Data security - proprietary and sensitive data
	- proprietary - has commercial value, is "owned"
	- sensitive - intimate or confidential

## Risk Analysis
- Notoriously difficult in cybersecurity
- de-perimeterisation - security spans the boundaries ofmultiple parties
- problem of many hands - difficult to decide who is responsible

# Ethical Issues
## Incident Response
- When should an organization go public about an attack?
- What informaton should be disclosed?
- How should organization balance eradication (kicking out intruder) vs. recovery (getting back online)?
- Should they notify law enforcement? When?

## Attribution
- How can we know who initiated a cyberattack? How confident can we be?
- Easy for hackers to cover their tracks or flasify information (implicating other victims)
- Proper forensic investigation extremely difficult and crosses many borders
- At what point are we confident enough to attributing an attack to an entity?

## Hack-back
- When under cyberattack, is it ethical to respond in kind?
- Bills proposed to make limited hack-back legal
	- "Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act" amends CFAA
- Possible third parties will be harmed (attribution is hard)
- What if you make a mistake?

## Vulnerability Disclosure
- Nondisclosure - keep vulnerability secret
- Full disclosure - distribute knowledge of the vulnerability, so potential victims can protect themselves
- Limited Disclosure - privately disclosure to the vendor only, so they can develop a patch

## Responsible Disclosure
1. Disclose ulnerability to vendor in private
2. Agree on a deadline for full disclosure
3. Both parties maintain communication during patch development
4. Vulnerability is fully disclosed

## Bug Bounties
- Offer rewards to researchers who discover vulnerabilities
- Encourages responsible disclosure

# Hackers
## Levy's "Hacker Ethic"
I. Access to computers should be unlimited
II. All inforation should be free
III. Mistrust authority
IV. Hackers should be judged by their skill
V. You can create art and beauty on a computer
VI. Computers can change your life for the better

Levy was a journalist who wrote a lot about early hackers. He wrote a distillation of the ethics.

## Problematic Hacker Ethos
1. Information should be free (actively break into stuff)
2. Hackers provide society with a useful service
3. Activities in cyberspace are virtual

## Hacker "Hats"
- Black hat - maliciously breaks into systems for personal gain
- White hat - breaks into systems to improve security
	- "ethical hacker" or "pentester"
- Grey hat - may violate laws or ethical standards, but not maliciously

## Ethical Hacker
Hacking systems with
1. permission
2. expertise
3. document vulnerabilities
