# Crime and Law

IANAL

Law - Any system of regulations to govern the conudct of the people of an org, community, society, or nation
Crime - Punishment for breaking the law

Criminal Laws - laws written by Congress and state legislators that make certain behavior illegal and punishable by fines and /or imprisonment. Criminal law also includes decisions by appellate courts that define crimes and regulate criminal procedure in the absence of clear legislated rules.

### Philosophical Definitions
- Cybercrime - committing a criminal act using cybertechnology, everything takes place inside "cyberrealm"
- (not really important, too unclear) Cyber-assisted crime - a crime in which criminal acts are exacerbated or assisted by cybertechnology

### Before a trial
- Investigation - law enforcement investigates crime, proesecutor decides when to try to bring charges
- Grand Jury (of your peers) - jury decides if sufficient evidence to formally bring charges
- Indictment - formal notice of a criminal charge

### Who investigates?
- FBI, DEA, ATF, USSS, ICE, (US Postal Inspection Service) USPIS, FTC, FCC

### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- Title 18 US Code Section 1030
- Enacted in 1986
	- Seen as response to the movie War Games
	- Protected "federal computers" (gov't interest)
- In 1996, expanded to "protected computers"
	- Used by federal gov't or financial institution
	- Involved in interstate commerce
	- Also expanded to include using malicious code

1+ years - Felony
<= 1 years - Misdemeanor

### CFAA Controversies
- What constitutes a "protected computer"?
- What constitutes access "without authorization" or "exceeding authorization"?
- What constitutes damage and loss?

### Digital Millineium Copyright Act, DMCA (1996)
- 17 US Code Section 1201
- Anti-Circumvention Provision criminalizes circumventing copyright protection (Digital Rights Management - DRM)
- "No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title."


## US Investigation Laws
### 4th Amendment - Search and Seizure
- What can gov't access your data?
- Warrant required when person has reasonable expectation of privacy
- However, they can disregard this if:
	- Exigent circumstances
	- Plain view (if it's in plain view)
	- Permission/Consent
		- ALWAYS SAY NO!! Go get a warrant.
- "Fruit of the poisonous tree" - evidence collected improperly can be thrown out by a judge

### Warrant vs. Subpoena
- Subpoena - a court order issued at the request of a party requiring a witness to testify, produce specified evidence, or both
- Warrant - an order signed by a judge...

### Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), 1986
- Three Laws:
	- Wiretap Act - Search warrant required for communication in transit
	- Stored Communications Act
	- Pen Trap Provisions
		- Phone conversation content requires a warrant
		- ...

### Stored Communictions Act
- Governs voluntary disclosure of stored information
- Governs how government can compel disclosure
	- Warrant - requires probable cause
	- 2703(d) order - requires specific facts be relevant
	- Subpoena - requires reasonable relevance
- Gov't does not need a warrant for communications stored by a third party

### Third Party Doctrine
- Legal theory (based on precedent, not a law)
- Things held out in public are **not** considered **reasonably private**
- Information voluntarily givento a third party is **not private**
- Data shared with banks, ISPs, social media providers, cell providers, and email providers **do not necessarily require a warrant**
