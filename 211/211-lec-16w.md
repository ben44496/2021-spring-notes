# Intellectual Property

- What is property?
  - We tend to think of *tangible* items, like land
- Property as a Form of "Control"
	- Property can best be understood as a relationship between individuals in reference to things
- Intellectual vs. Tangible Objects
	- Tangible objects are *exclusionary* in nature
	- Intellectual objects are *non-exclusionary*
- Ideas vs. Expressions of ideas
	- If an idea is literary or artistic in nature, it must be expressed (or "fixed") in some tangible medium in order to be protected
	- If idea is functional in nature, it must be expressed in terms of a machine or process
- Philosophical Foundations
	- **Labor theory** - all property is natural right given to the laborer, including IP
	- **Utilitarian theory** - IP is an artificial right granted to promote innovation, which benefits society (U.S.)
	- **Personality theory** - IP is a moral right, extension of your person/your identity (more European Union style)

## Law and Intellectual Property
- IP Protection Schemes
	- Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, Trade secrets, (also likeness like for celebrity)
### Copyright
- Copyright
	- Copyrights holders have the exclusive right to:
		- make copies of their work
		- produce deriative works, translations, movies, etc.
		- distribute copies
		- perform works in public (musicals, plays, etc)
		- display works in public (e.g. art)
		- copy right guarantees control for life of artist + 70 years (or more!)
- Copyright Law
	- In 1976, copyright law was extended to include:
		- programs, computers, databases that "exhibit authorship"
		- To get a copyright for a computer program, the uathor ahd to show that the program contained an original expression of ideas and not simply the ideas themselves
- Fair Use
	- Use of another person's copyrighted work for purposes:
		- criticism, comment, teaching, scholarship, research
	- Factors considered:
		- Purpose and character (profit - bad, parody - good, transformative - good vs. derivative - bad)
		- Nature of the work (facts and public interest)
		- Amount of the work used
		- Effect on market value (not criticism, only substitute if others buy yours instead of others)
- First-Sale Doctrine
	- Once you purchased a fixed version of the work (copy of a book, audio tape, etc.) you are free to give away, resell, or even destroy the copy of that work.
	- It is clear whether one is permitted to give away digital versions of the work

### Patents
- Patents
	- A patent is legal protection given to individuals who create an invention or process
	- Unlike copyrights, patents offer 20 years of protection
	- Protection can be applied to inventions and discoveries that include functional devcies such as machines, "artcieles of manufacture," or "compositions of matter
	- Patents are granted to inventions and discoveries that satisfy three conditions:
		- usefulness
		- novelty
		- non-obviousness

### Trademarks
- A trademarks is a word, name phrase, or symbol that indentifies a product or service
- The Lanham Act, also referred to as the Trademark Act of 1946, was passed to provide protection for registered trademarks

### Trade Secrets
- Infomration that is sufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential economic advantage
- Protected by nondisclosure agreements (NDA)
- Trade secrets can be used to protect:
	- formulas, blueprints, chemical compounds, process of manufacturing

- Software as Intellectual Property
	- Software is not expressed or "fixed"in a tangible medium
	- resembles algorithms, which, like mathematical ideas or "mental steps," are not elgible for patent protection
	- Eventually however, both are allowed (copyright and patents)

## IP and Cybertechnology
- Free Software Foundation (FSF)
	- Four "freedoms" are essential:
		- run the program, for any purpose
		- study how the program works, and adapt it for your needs
		- redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
		- improve the program, and release your improvements to the public so that the whole community benefits
- Open Source Initiative (OSI)
	- Like FSF, OSI requires that the source code for "open source software" (OSS) is freely availble
	- More concerned with open source as a development process
	- Allow for BSD and MPL licenses
	- Less restrictive, allows for proprietary use
- Intellectual Commons
	- We have framed laws and policies to protect the physical commons (ie. parks, air, natural resouces)
	- The intellectual commons is now threatened by strong intellectual property laws
- Creative Commons - Lawrence Lessig
	- Nonprofit organization launched in 2001
	- Leverage copyright law to give greater flexibility, not "all or nothing"
	- Provides a "menu" of options for creator to waive/retain rights
	- Creative Commons Menu
		- Attribution - Permit others to distribute, display, perform works, and create derivatives based upon it only if they give you credit
		- Noncommercial - Permit ... only for noncommercial purposes
		- Derivative works - ... perform only verbatim copies of the work, not derivative works based upon it
		- Share alike - Permit others to distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the license that governs your work


- DMCA - Safe harbor
	- Created concept for a "takedown notice"
	- Provides "safe harbor" provision for ISPs
		- Protects them from users' actions
		- They act as a "carrier" or "conduit" only
- DMCA - Right to Repair
	- Criminalized circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) technology
	- Can be used to lock consumers out of devices they have purchased
	- Cannon repair themselves or pay 3rd party
	- TV, cars, phones, tractors, game consoles, medical equipment
- Patent Trolls
	- Patents guarantee a monopoly even if a product is independently developed
	- Companies buy patents with no intent to express the patent
	- Sue after products are brought to market
	- This is called **rent seeking** - using law to collect wealth without producing new wealth
	- Software is a particularly easy target
