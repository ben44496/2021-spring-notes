Black-Box Problem
* Trained ML models can be extremely complicated

Algorithmic Fairness
* ML models can be biased
* Proxy discrimination is possible even when not explicit
	* training data can have human bias
	* surrogate features for race or gender or income may be present

Accuracy Pardox
* High accuracy does not mean that a model is good

Proxy-Discrimination
* A seemingly neutral variable encodes biased information

P-hacking
* Only showing statistically significant results or transforming your data to get more statistically significant results

Black-box problem
* Inability to determine how or why an algorithm generates its output

Paradox of the false positive
* More false positives than true false positives

Overfitting
* When the ML algorithm learns the specifics of the training data and is not generalizable.
