# Go over midterm:

2. (e) Could be 4 streams if we consider 1 AP and 1 Client. But if we assume 4, we assume clients can talk to each other and transmit all channel values and all data packets. This might be more overhead. For IAC, it is just the channel values and not data. 

If we assume the 4 packet case, the antennas of the APs limits the packet, and we need to also transmit the data as well in order to solve using all $y_i$, as otherwise if we only used two then we have a linear combination without enough information to split it. 

3. (c) We need $\theta = cos^{-1}(-\frac{1}{4})$ or $cos^{-1}(\frac{3}{4})$

Question why mod $2$? instead of mod $2\pi$ after taking $cos$? 

Answer: Because of the range of $-1 \leq \cos^{-1} \leq 1$ so we have to mod 2.

1. (a) FMCW is negative slope, but can also be positive?

2. (a) Passes through the origin

Question: When would I want a no-bias classification?

5. (d) A 3 layer deep NN is good enough to approximate any function???

Question: How would changing the NLF change what the Neural Net looks like?

6. (b) $f(x)$ is not linearly separable

Question: For semantics, isn't it linearly separable, but just not well?

7. (a) Also include ensemble, dropout

7. (b) $\lambda|w|_0$ or $\lambda|w|_1$
