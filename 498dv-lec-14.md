## ... something about putting on IoT
- Why do we want to run ML models on cheap resources constrained devices?
"low-latency", low-energy, "networking" available
"inexpensive"
"Privacy"

... example case with Arduino Uno

## Options
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
	- But can't perform well near curves

## Bonsai: Key IDeas
Idea: Maximum performance given limited input

$y(x) = \sum_k i_k(x)W_k^TZx\circ tanh(\sigma V_k^TZx)$

Reduce input $x$ using PCA to a 5 or 10 dimensional space ($Z$). 

$W$ is the actual weights. $V$ is the weighting of importance.
$I_k$ is whether or not the node is in that path.
$Zx$ is after the PCA so we have around 5-10 dimensions in there
We sum over each node (in the path because of $I_k$)

## Sparse Projections
"Streaming Manner" for $Z$.

Typically, we read from memory, and then we discard if we don't need it anymore. In Python Generators, it's sampling point by point. However Bonsai reads one input and just divides that into it's features. 

Streamin Manner here means think about it like we are trying to add up all the rows of $Z$ and $x$ such that we only store 10 + 10 values??

If your output vector is even smaller, you can fit it into one register to make it even faster. 

## Loss function
Not gonna write it out but it's basically:

Regularization of ($\theta, w, V, Z$) + Some other loss function we talked about
s.t. $||Z||_0 \leq B_Z, ||\Theta||_0 \leq B_{\Theta}$

$B_Z$ and $B_{\Theta}$ are the memory and storage constraints. Note these are using the zero norms. 

## Training Process
Option 1: Train a model without budget constraints, then set the smallest values to "pruning" zero
