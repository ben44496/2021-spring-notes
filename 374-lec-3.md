## Finite State Machines (Deterministic Finite Automata)
$Q$ - Finite *set* of states
$s \in Q$ - Some start state in $Q$
$A \subseteq Q$ - Accepting states
$\Sigma$ - input alphabet, finite set (e.g. $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$)
$\delta: Q\times\Sigma \rightarrow Q$ - Transition Function; "You are in a state, input alphabet, you are again in a new or same state"

Example:
$L = \{\text{strings that contain an even number of 1s}\}$
Code--
```
EvenOnes(w[1...n]):
	ones <- 0
	for i = 1 to n:
		if w[i] = 1:
			ones <- (1+ones) mod 2
	if ones == 0:
		TRUE
	else:
		FALSE
```

**Note**: Accept state is denoted by the double ring.
$\delta[q,a] = (q+a) mod 2$
**Note**: Transition table is also valid, but not shown here. Make sure to draw arrow to start state.
```
MyExample(...):
	q <- 0
	for i = 1 to n:
		q <- delta(q, w[i])
	
```

### Extended State Transition Function
**Definition:**
$\delta^*: Q\times \Sigma^* \rightarrow Q$
$\delta^*(q,w) =$
- $q$ if $w = \epsilon$
- $\delta^*(\delta(q,a),x)$ if $w = ax$
or
- $q$ if $w = \epsilon$
- $\delta(\delta^*(q,a),x)$ if $w = ax$

This equivalence can be proven by induction

Machine $M$ accepts $W \Leftrightarrow \delta^*(\text{start},w\in A)$
$M = Q, s\in Q, A\subseteq Q, \Sigma, \delta \text{ or } \delta^*$
$L(M) = \{w\in\Sigma^* | M \text{accepts} W\}$

**IMPORTANT: If you miss any of these definitions, the description of your machine is incomplete.**

Example:
$L = \{\text{strings containing 11}\} = (0+1)^*11(0+1)^*$
Need only three state which keeps track of how many $1$s in a row you have seen:
- 0
- 1
- 11

$0$ state: Last symbol (if any) is a $0$, have not seen $11$
$1$ state: Last symbol is a $1$, have not seen $11$.
$11$ state: Have seen $11$.
**IMPORTANT: Must right the meaning of each state after writing machine**

Example:
```
MultipleOf5(w[1...n]):
	rem = 0
	for i <- 1 to n
		rem = (2*rem+w[i]) mod 5
		if rem = 0:
			return True
		else:
			return False
```

$\delta(q,a) = (2q+a) \text{ mod } 5$

<!-- Any machine is automatic is all language excepted by a FSM ???-->

### Example of a Language that is not Regular?
$L = \{0^n1^n: n \text{ is an integer } \geq 0\}$
