# Professionalism
- CS has been losing trust... do we belong in engineering? Engineers hold themselves to really high standards

## Professional
- Occupation where decisions and actions have significant social effects (e.g. doctors, lawyers)
- Roles and responsibilities exceed those of non-professionals

## ACM Code of Ethics

- Professional decision-making process is potentially compromised
- *Perception* of a conflict can be just as bad

Challenger Disaster

Richard Feynman - Charged with leading investigation into Challenger disaster
Bob Ebeling - Former NASA engineer, knew problem probably was O-ring

## Safety Critical Software
- A computer system that can have a direct life-threatening impact
	- air traffic control, mass transportation, nuclear reactors, missile systems, medical equipment, design/architecture software, medicalanalysis software

## Whistleblowing
- Individual calls attention to negligence, abuses, or dangers that threaten the public interest
- "Sound the alarm" from within the organization
- ... but also a form of dissent
- Can have destructive side-effects

### When to blow the whistle?
- **Richard De George's criteria**
	- Morally *permitted* to blow the whistle
		- The product will do serious harm to the public
		- The engineer has reported threat to supevisor
		- The engineer has exhausted all internal procedures
	- Morally obligated to blow the whistle
		- (First 3 must apply)
		- The engineer has accessible, documented evidence that their view of the situation is correct
		- The engineer has good reasons to believe that going public is necessary to bring about change

# Ethics 2.0
### Act vs. Rule Utilitarianism
- Act utilitarianism - *actions* should lead to greatest happiness
- Rule utilitarianism - follow *rules* that lead to greatest happiness
### Rule vs. Act Deontology
- Rule deontology - make decisions according to fixed objective universal rules
- Act Deontology - analyze individual situation and act according to the *most important* duty
